# Online-Casino-ERD
Designing the ERD of an online casino using MySQL Workbench, loading it with data, and answering business questions. This was done for my SQL II course in my first term


1. The "DDL.sql" file is used to create all tables, primary keys, and foreign keys for the model
2. The "DML.sql" file is used to load the sample data into each of the tables
3. The "Queries.sql" file is used to answer the quetions provided for the project
4. The ".mwb" file can be used to visualize the ERD within MySQL Workbench
5. The ".pdf" file is a detailed breakdown of the model and the answer to our questions
6. The linear graph data.csv was used to visualize the profits over time
